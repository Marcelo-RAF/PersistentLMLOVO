# PersistentLMLOVO

This project focuses on solving detection problems using an algorithm called **Persistent Levenberg-Marquardt LOVO**.

## Installation Instructions

This package is not yet available in `Metadata.jl`, so it cannot be installed directly using the Julia package manager. To install it, follow these steps:

1. Open the Julia REPL.

2. Press `]` to enter Pkg mode.

3. Run the following command:

   ```julia
   pkg> add https://github.com/Marcelo-RAF/PersistentLMLOVO.git
   ```

4. After installation, press Backspace to return to the Julia REPL.

5. To start using the package, simply run:

   ```julia
   julia> using PersistentLMLOVO
   ```

That's it! Now you can start using the package.

## Running the Algorithm

You can download test examples from the following repository: [PersistentLMLOVO Test Problems](https://github.com/Marcelo-RAF/PersistentLMLOVO/tree/main/problems). Available datasets include:

- **Lines**
- **2D Spheres**
- **3D Spheres**
- **Cubic Functions**
- **Quadratic Functions**

Each category contains problems with only outliers as well as problems with noise and outliers combined.

### Running an Example

To run an example, navigate to the directory where your test data is stored. Suppose you have a file named `line2d_2.0_-4.0_15.csv`, you can load it with:

```julia
julia> prob = load_problem("line2d_2.0_-4.0_15.csv")
```

Once the problem is loaded, you can perform detection using either the **Persistent LMLOVO** or **LMLOVO** algorithm as follows:

```julia
julia> MinimalLMPersistent(xk, prob.model, prob.data, prob.dim, prob.nout)
```

```julia
julia> MinimalLMLOVO(xk, prob.model, prob.data, prob.dim, prob.nout)
```

Where `xk` is the initial guess with dimensions compatible with the problem being analyzed.

To reproduce comparison tests between **Persistent LMLOVO** and **LMLOVO**, use the benchmark scripts available at the following link in the directory of the problems you want to compare:

[![Benchmark Scripts](https://img.shields.io/badge/Benchmark%20Scripts-Link-blue)](https://github.com/Marcelo-RAF/PersistentLMLOVO/tree/main/scripts)

There are two scripts, `lmlovobench.jl` and `plmlovobench.jl`, which generate the files `lmlovoinfo.csv` and `plmlovoinfo.csv`, respectively. These files contain the problem names, the number of points, the number of outliers, the algorithm's solution, the residual found (the sum of the distances from the problem points to the solution), and the median execution time for each problem run 100 times.
